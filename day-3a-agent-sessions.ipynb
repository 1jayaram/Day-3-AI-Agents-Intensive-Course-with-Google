    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second point I made about **De Novo Drug Design and Optimization**. This is a really exciting area because it's about AI *creating* new medicines from scratch, rather than just finding existing ones or tweaking them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on what that entails and why it's so significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De Novo\" is Latin for \"from the beginning.\" In drug discovery, de novo design means creating entirely new molecular structures that are optimized to interact with a specific biological target (like a protein that's causing a disease) and possess desirable drug-like properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Powers De Novo Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional drug discovery often starts with known drug scaffolds or libraries of existing compounds. De novo design with AI flips this by asking the AI to *generate* novel molecules. This is achieved through sophisticated AI techniques, primarily:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Generative Models:** These are types of machine learning algorithms designed to create new data that resembles the data they were trained on. In drug discovery, they are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties.\n",
      "    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator tries to create new molecules, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real molecules (from the training data) and the generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce highly realistic and novel molecular structures.\n",
      "    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecular structures. By sampling from this latent space and decoding it, VAEs can generate new molecular variants.\n",
      "    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL agents can be trained to \"explore\" the vast chemical space and learn to design molecules that meet specific criteria, often guided by a reward function that scores molecules based on desired properties.\n",
      "    *   **Transformer Models:** Inspired by their success in natural language processing, transformer architectures are now being adapted to generate molecular sequences (like SMILES strings) that represent valid and novel chemical structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Optimization Algorithms:** Once a generative model produces potential candidates, optimization algorithms (which can also be AI-driven) fine-tune these molecules. This involves:\n",
      "    *   **Property Prediction:** Using predictive AI models to estimate how well the generated molecule will bind to the target, its solubility, its metabolic stability, its potential toxicity (ADMET properties), and other crucial factors.\n",
      "    *   **Iterative Refinement:** The AI can then iteratively modify the molecule based on these predictions to improve its overall profile. For example, if a generated molecule binds well but is predicted to be toxic, the AI can suggest modifications to reduce toxicity while maintaining binding affinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Advantages of AI-Driven De Novo Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Exploration of Novel Chemical Space:** AI can design molecules with entirely new chemical scaffolds that human chemists might not have conceived of. This can lead to drugs with novel mechanisms of action and potentially overcome resistance issues with existing drugs.\n",
      "*   **Speed and Efficiency:** AI can generate and evaluate millions of virtual molecules much faster than traditional methods. This drastically accelerates the early stages of drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Optimization for Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** AI can be trained to consider a multitude of factors (binding affinity, solubility, synthetic accessibility, low toxicity) at once, leading to better-rounded drug candidates from the outset.\n",
      "*   **Tailoring to Specific Targets:** AI can be trained to design molecules that are highly specific for a particular disease target, reducing off-target effects and improving efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a \"new development\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "While the concept of computational drug design has existed for decades, the recent advancements in deep learning, access to massive chemical and biological datasets, and powerful computing resources have made de novo design truly transformative. Generative AI models are now capable of producing molecules that are not only valid but also often show promising biological activity in experimental validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, AI-driven de novo drug design is moving from discovering existing solutions to creating entirely new ones, revolutionizing how we approach the challenge of finding effective medicines.**\n",
