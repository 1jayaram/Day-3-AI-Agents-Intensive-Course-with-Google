During the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google, I explored the Context Engineering Sessions Memory by completing codelabs on Kaggle.

Day 3a - Agent Sessions

Day 3b - Agent Memory

What I learnt during the 3rd day,

1. Studied session and memory architectures needed for stateful and personalized agent experiences.
2. Engineered agents to manage conversation history and add long-term memory that persists across sessions.
3. Enabled multi-turn coherent conversations and memory recall for improved context awareness.
